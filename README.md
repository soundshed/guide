# Spark Amp Guide
A community-maintained guide to getting started with the Positive Grid Spark Amp, including frequently asked questions.

## Orders
Most/many spark amp orders are pre-orders via the Positive Grid website. Depending on your geographic location and when you ordered most customers have experienced long (several month) delays in receiving their amps. Customers ordering today can expect less wait time. The amp is not generally available in stores currently.

## Getting Started

## Apps

Get the Spark Amp App for your device:

Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.positivegrid.spark&hl=en

iPad/iPhone: https://apps.apple.com/au/app/spark-amp/id1457653921

There is currently no app for desktop computers (Windows or mac OS).

Confusingly, Positive Grid also make a music tuition app called Spark Edu which is a subscription service that is no relation to your Spark amp. You do not have to pay to use the spark app with your amp, so if something is asking for money you've gone to the wrong place.
